## Quality Education for All
Sage addresses the challenge of accessible, quality education for all. Whether you're a student struggling with traditional learning, someone pursuing a personal goal, or simply curious, Sage offers a custom-tailored learning journey, ensuring educational resources are accessible, engaging, and effective for every learner.

## United Nations' Sustainable Development goals and targets
My solution targets SDG 4: Quality Education, specifically focusing on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. Inspired by the transformative power of education and technology's role in democratizing access, we aim to bridge the educational divide, making learning accessible to everyone, everywhere.

## Implementation
Sage's architecture is built on a simple yet effective tech stack, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive, user-friendly interface. Given the project's nascent stage, our focus was on developing a prototype to showcase the concept. Future development will integrate AI for personalized learning paths and Google APIs for content aggregation and calendar integration

I opted for familiar technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to rapidly develop a prototype, demonstrating our vision for Sage. This approach allowed me to focus on ideation and user experience, setting a foundation for integrating more advanced technologies and Google APIs in future iterations.

Continuous development is at the heart of Sage. While user testing was limited due to time constraints, initial feedback from peers emphasized the need for personalized learning paths, accessibility features, and community support. These insights will guide further development, ensuring Sage meets the diverse needs of its users.

## Completion of Solution
Sage's impact is evident in its potential to make learning accessible and personalised. It automates the resources gathering process of any goal and guides the user to develop an effective plan to achieve academic and personal goals. A majority of students spend half their study time searching for resources to help them prepare and understand the material better, with the help of Sage those students can study twice as much with resources that are equal to what they found or better.

## Scalability
Future developments for Sage include expanding the content library, incorporating AI for adaptive learning experiences, and building a community of learners and educators. Substantial architectural enhancements will support scalability, ensuring Sage can accommodate a growing global user base.

## Next Steps
With a foundational architecture designed for flexibility and scalability, Sage is poised to grow. Future enhancements will include cloud-based services for robust data management and analytics, enabling us to reach and impact a larger audience while continuously improving the learning experience.
